# weather-dashboard

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a web application that provides the current day and next 5 day weather forecast for a city entered by the user.

To provide this information to the user, two Open Weather API requests are required. The first API request returns the current day forecast and latitude and longitude coordinates for the city entered by the user. The coordinates are used in the second API request which returns the 5 day forecast.

The recent city searches are saved in local stores and then rendered as a list of buttons. The buttons can also be used to search in addition to using the text area.
